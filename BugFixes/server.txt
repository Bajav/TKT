{
"message": "Something went wrong",
"error": "Operation airlines.find() buffering timed out after 10000ms"
} 

the above error came in because of the lack of a direct 
connection between the model and server

the fix

// initiate models

from
const IATACODE =  new mongoose.model("IATACODE", iataSchema);
const Airline =  new mongoose.model("Airline", airlineSchema);

to
const IATACODE =  iataConnection.model("IATACODE", iataSchema);
const Airline =  airlineConnection.model("Airline", airlineSchema);

Error two

---USER SIGN IN AND AUTH---
user signs in by google OAUTH creates uID which is stored on the 
firestore database with other credentials, however as user signs in 
or up  we also trigger another route on the express server , to which
the uID is posted and a cookie is created containing that user ID,
after this incase user refreshs the browser , we get to send a get req to
the back end (express) to check if user cookie is available , if it is
we get the user ID stored in init to the frontend which is used to check 
whether user is signed in on firestore db until user logs out thats when the 
cookie is destroyed

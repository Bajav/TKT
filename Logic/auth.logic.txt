user signs with firebase from frontend with react, 
a post req is sent to the backend to save the user UID 
in the cookie, when the user refreshes the brower, a get req is made 
and cookie is sent out to frontend, the cookie is opened to exposing 
the UID which is used to check if user exists in the firestore DB if he/she does
the user snapshot is sent back to authenticate and retrieve user

or 

we can also store the user details upon signin ie email, displayname, 
image url etc in the cookie, then use the cookie to authenticate user upon browser refresh .


users like a place and travel agencies bid on them
